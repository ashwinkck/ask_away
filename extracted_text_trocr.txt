Time Allowed : Three Hours Maximum Marks : 200

Question Paper Specific Instructions

Please read each of the following instructions carefully before attempting
questions:

There are NINE questions divided under FIVE sections.
Candidate has to attempt FIVE questions in all.
The ONLY question in Section A is compulsory.

Out of the remaining EIGHT questions, the candidate has to attempt FOUR, choosing
ONE from each of the other Sections B, C, D and E.

The number of marks carried by a question/part is indicated against it.
Symbols, abbreviations and notations have their usual standard meanings.
Neat sketches are to be drawn to illustrate answers, wherever required.

Wherever required, graphs/tables are to be drawn on the Question-cum-Answer (QCA)
Booklet itself:

Attempts of questions shall be counted in sequential order. Unless struck off, attempt of a
question shall be counted even if attempted partly.

Any page or portion of the page left blank in the Question-cum-Answer (QCA) Booklet must
be clearly struck off.

Answers must be written in ENGLISH only.
