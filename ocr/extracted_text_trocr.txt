Il]. PROPOSED DEMENTIA CARE APPLICATION DESIGN

This section outlines the key strategies and improvements
incorporated into the proposed dementia care application to
enhance quality, performance, precision, safety, progress
tracking, and real-time functionality.

To enhance quality, the application offers a personalized user
experience by dynamically adjusting the difficulty levels of
cognitive games and exercises based on user performance.
This approach keeps patients engaged without causing
overwhelm or boredom. Prediction models leverage diverse
inputs such as medical history, demographic data, and
lifestyle factors to provide tailored and accurate risk
assessments. The comprehensive feature set integrates
detection, prevention, rehabilitation, and caregiver support
tools into a unified platform for dementia care. Enriched with
educational content, reminders, and community support
features, the application promotes sustained engagement and
overall user satisfaction. Additionally, real-time feedback
mechanisms on patient activities like game performance and
medication adherence empower caregivers to intervene
proactively, improving outcomes. User surveys and in-app
feedback channels further ensure that the application evolves
to meet caregiver needs. Performance is enhanced through
machine learning model optimization, with the Random
Forest model via hyperparameter tuning. Regular model
evaluation and retraining on updated datasets enable the
system to adapt to changing patient data, ensuring robust
performance. Efficient backend systems, powered by
Firebase, provide real-time data synchronization and secure
storage, delivering low latency and high reliability even
under heavy usage. Load balancing techniques are
implemented to handle peak traffic, especially during
emergencies, ensuring uninterrupted service.

The system’s real-time GPS tracking capabilities are
achieved through Firebase integration, which continuously
updates patient locations and synchronizes this data with
caregivers. Secure location data storage ensures privacy
while offering instant access to authorized users. Geofencing
features allow caregivers to define safe zones for patients,
triggering immediate alerts if these zones are breached. GPS
data is updated every five seconds to maintain accuracy while

IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The proposed system architecture (fig. 1) is structured into
four primary layers to ensure seamless operation and user
engagement. The User Interface Layer provides intuitive
access through features such as login and sign-up, along with
distinct tabs for detection, prevention, and rehabilitation. The
Detection Tab Components incorporate input parameters like
age, gender, genetic predispositions, cognitive test scores,
and lifestyle factors. These are processed through machine
learning models that utilize structured data and feature
extraction techniques to predict dementia risk accurately. At
the core, the system employs a hybrid model combining a
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and _ ResNet-50,
achieving an accuracy of 83.5% ona dataset of 10,000 patient
records. The Prevention and Rehabilitation Tab Components
include tools for healthy habit education, location tracking,
medication reminders, and engaging cognitive activities such
as memory games and books, all aimed at enhancing patient
outcomes and caregiver support. Supporting these
functionalities is a robust Backend System, which leverages
Firebase for secure data management, real-time
synchronization, and encryption to maintain patient
confidentiality.

The system’s workflow (fig. 2) begins with Data Collection,
gathering information such as demographics, cognitive test
scores, and lifestyle factors from patients and caregivers. This
data undergoes Preprocessing to clean and organize it,
followed by Data Splitting into training (80%) and testing
(20%) subsets. During the Classification phase, the hybrid
model integrates the FNN and ResNet-50 to analyze features
and predict dementia risk. Critical factors are identified
during Feature Selection, focusing on elements like age,
cognitive test scores, and medical history. The model is then
trained and optimized to achieve high accuracy. Finally, the
system outputs detailed risk assessments and insights for
caregivers and healthcare providers, supporting personalized
interventions and informed decision-making.
